Password Generator and Encoding Project 
By: Daniel (Joo Hyung) Lee (mangoclient)

Passwords come in different sizes and lengths filled with numbers, letters, and symbols. In order to 
create a strong password, there should be a variation of multiple numbers, upper and lower case 
letters, and symbols. Having a strong password gives hackers a harder and longer time to brute-force 
crack your password. In this project, I created a script in python that helps generate a random string of 
ASCII text in numbers and letters. 
    
Following the randomly generated password, I give users an option to encode their password into different
formats. Encoding is a process of converting data into a format that gives machines the ability to execute, 
compile, and commit processes. In short, these specialized formats are done in order to create a efficient 
transmission rate for data and or storage as well. With so many new symbols, characters, and even emojis 
now apart of the internet, the ASCII encoding was not ideal because of the large amount of characters. 
For this reason, Unicode was created. Unicode helped solve the problems  that encoding and code pages were 
causing. Unicode takes unicode transform protocols, (UTF) to help encode every single Unicode code point
we need. They differ in sizes but the most comment and efficient method is UTF-8 which takes one byte per 
code point. 
    
Encoding is not encrypting. Encoding is simply the maintaining of data usability. It can be reversed by 
the same algorithm that encoded the information. Encryption on the other hand is maintaining information
confidentiality and would require a key in order to decrypt the ciphertext back to plain text.
